## ü§ù Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Web Server** - Any static file server (Apache, Nginx, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **HTTPS Support** - Required for service worker testing
- **Modern Browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Git** - For version control
- **Text Editor** - VS Code, Sublime Text, or your preferred editor

### Quick Start

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pwa_kit.git
   cd pwa_kit
   ```
3. **Set up the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ftaisdeal/pwa_kit.git
   ```
4. **Test the setup** by serving the files locally with HTTPS

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Local Development Server

Choose one of these methods to serve the PWA locally with HTTPS:

#### Option 1: Python HTTPS Server
```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate (first time only)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

# Serve with HTTPS
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
# Then use a reverse proxy for HTTPS or use a tool like mkcert
```

#### Option 2: Node.js with http-server
```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem -p 8000
```

#### Option 3: VS Code Live Server Extension
- Install the "Live Server" extension
- Configure it to use HTTPS
- Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

### Testing Your Setup

1. Open `https://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. Accept the self-signed certificate warning
3. Verify that:
   - Service worker registers successfully
   - Connectivity detection works
   - PWA can be installed
   - Offline functionality works

## üìè Coding Standards

### JavaScript

- Use **ES6+ features** where appropriate
- Use **async/await** instead of promises when possible
- Add **JSDoc comments** for functions
- Use **descriptive variable names**
- Follow **consistent indentation** (2 spaces)

```javascript
/**
 * Checks network connectivity using multiple endpoints
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} True if connected, false otherwise
 */
async function checkConnectivity() {
  // Implementation here
}
```
