### 2. Report Privately

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us directly at:

**📧 Security Contact:** `security@[your-domain].com`

*(Please replace with your actual security contact email)*

### 3. Include the Following Information

To help us understand and resolve the issue quickly, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., XSS, CSRF, code injection, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 4. Response Timeline

You can expect the following response timeline:

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours of report submission
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates:** Weekly updates on our progress
- **Resolution:** Timeframe varies based on severity and complexity

## Security Best Practices

When using PWA Kit, please follow these security best practices:

### For Developers

- **Always use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Validate and sanitize** all user inputs
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Review service worker** implementations for security implications
- **Implement proper Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
- **Use secure authentication** mechanisms for user data

### For Deployment

- **Enable HTTPS** on your web server
- **Configure proper headers**:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **Regularly update** your web server and hosting environment
- **Monitor for suspicious activity** and implement logging

### Service Worker Security

- **Cache only trusted resources** in your service worker
- **Validate cache contents** before serving to users
- **Implement proper error handling** to prevent information disclosure
- **Use network-first strategies** for sensitive data
- **Regularly update cached resources** to include security patches

## Disclosure Policy

- **Responsible Disclosure:** We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to verify and address reported vulnerabilities.
- **Public Disclosure:** Once a vulnerability is fixed, we will publish details about the issue and our response.
- **Credit:** We will publicly credit researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly (if desired).

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- **Released promptly** for critical vulnerabilities
- **Clearly documented** in release notes with severity levels
- **Communicated** through GitHub releases and security advisories
- **Backward compatible** when possible, or with clear migration paths

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- ✅ The core PWA Kit codebase
- ✅ Service worker implementations
- ✅ Connectivity detection mechanisms
- ✅ Caching strategies and implementations
- ✅ Build and deployment configurations

This policy does **not** cover:

- ❌ Third-party dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- ❌ User-specific implementations and customizations
- ❌ Infrastructure and hosting environments
- ❌ Browser-specific security issues
